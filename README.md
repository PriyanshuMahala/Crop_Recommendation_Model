# Crop Recommendation Model

This project is using **ASP.NET** and **ML.NET** to predict which crop will be best suited for a soil with properties like **Nitrogen**, **Phosphorus**, **Potassium**, **Average temperature**, **Average humidity**, **Soil pH**, and **Average rainfall**. Currently I am not that experienced with machine learning so I used the automatic tool by Microsoft.
